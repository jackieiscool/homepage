        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>My name is Jackie Herrlin and I am a full-stack web developer. I specialize in Ruby on Rails, and agile web development.</p><br/>

            <p>A friend once stated that "the components that make up Jackie are git, rspec, and bowling." This seemed fairly accurate, though there are quite a few other things I care about.</p><br/>

            <p>Education is one of my primary passions in life, which is why I have spent the past 6 months working as an instructor in General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course, teaching others the skills they need to become full-stack web developers.</p><br/>

            <p>In addition to teaching others, I also care about education from a personal perspective, and am always looking for news ways to expand my own skills. Most recently I have been trying to delve deeper into javascript, and play with frameworks such as angular and node.</p>

            After my bowling team constantly said we should start keeping track of our individual and team averages, and were consistently too lazy to do so, I decided to create an app to help solve this very first world problem of ours.

            This is a project I initially started over a year ago at devbootcamp, and recently decided to pick up again. I have always been fascinated by Fantasy Football, and other fantasy sports but never bothered to play due to my disinterest in actually watching sports. I decided to instead create a fantasy game around one of my favorite topics, politics.
